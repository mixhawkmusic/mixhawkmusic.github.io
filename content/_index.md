Mix Hawk was born in Russia into a pro-actors family, so he was forced to study music before he started to talk.
When he turned 13, his life was dramatically inspired — almost by accident he got "Volunteer Jam 3&4" double LP
by Charlie Daniels Band with guests and friends. Also the same year (1985), Mix saw John Denver live in his native city of St. Petersburg.

Although he remained under the influence of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and other rock'n'roll bands,
Mix started dreaming about singing country music, which was almost impossible – nobody played American
country music in the Soviet Union. Anyway, he was the first in his 6 million population city to start wearing
cowboy hats and dressing like Willie Nelson.

And times – they are changing. The Soviet Union collapsed, and, little by little, American music started to penetrate
virgin Russian soil. Mix found a group of young musicians who were also crazy about country music and
joined them at age 17 to stay faithful to this music ever since.

Over the years, Mix Hawk became a legend in country music in the ex-USSR, performing, hosting radio shows, festivals,
and clubs. Even after becoming a Christian minister, he continued to perform occasionally, always gathering a large audience.

In 2014, Mix Hawk moved to the United States and in 2020 settled in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he keeps on preaching and singing.
